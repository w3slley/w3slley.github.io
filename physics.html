          <p>A lot of interesting things happen while you study Physics. Sometimes you feel on top of the world knowing that all the mathematics you study explain beautifuly nature's behavior, feeling privileged by simply being able to understand concepts that took the human mind hundreds, if not thousands of years to discover; others you feel like crap wondering if this or that concept will ever make sense to you given its difficulty. It's a pretty interesting (but also challenging) jorney, to be honest.</p>
          <p>Here are some photos I took while studying Physics at the Universidade do Porto.</p>

              <p>On this day I was going to have a thermodynamics test, so I went to the physics room (available for all students to go in and study) and put it on the board everything I thought was important to know. I thought it looked really awesome so I took a picture.</p>
