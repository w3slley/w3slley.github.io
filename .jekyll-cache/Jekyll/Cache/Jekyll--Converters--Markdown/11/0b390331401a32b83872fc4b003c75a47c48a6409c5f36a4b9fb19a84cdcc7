I"‚<p>Writing is something that helps me think more clearly, enabling me to separate time to think about ideas and concepts and then trying to come up with words which better capture their meaning. It is one habit I try to dedicate time to whenever I can, which these days is usually when I find time between studying physics and developing software. On this section you can find some of the stuff I‚Äôve written.</p>

<p>Some short stories I wrote in the past couple of years. They were written in portuguese and I‚Äôll try to translate them eventually.</p>

  <li><a href="/shortstories/o-incendio">O inc√™ndio</a> <em>(english version soon‚Ä¶)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h3>

<p>These include thoughts about science and technology and some reflections on how they impact modern life.</p>
