I"×<p>I just created a blog using the static site generator Jekyll (which makes really easy to set up something like this). Iâ€™ll use Jekyll until I manage to switch to the website/blog Iâ€™m in the process of finishing up (using Node.Js and MySQL - also having syntax highlighing and supporting MathJax). In here I plan to share thoughts and ideas related to software development, computer science, physics, among other things. If you think thatâ€™s cool, stay tuned.</p>
