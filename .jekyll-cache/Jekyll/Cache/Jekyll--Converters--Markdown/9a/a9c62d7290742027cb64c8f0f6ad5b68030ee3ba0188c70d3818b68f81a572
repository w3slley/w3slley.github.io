I"ý<p>A lot of interesting things happen while you study Physics. Sometimes you feel on top of the world knowing that all the mathematics you study explain beautifuly natureâ€™s behavior, feeling privileged by simply being able to understand concepts that took the human mind hundreds, if not thousands of years to discover; others you feel like crap wondering if this or that concept will ever make sense to you given its difficulty. Itâ€™s a pretty interesting (but also challenging) jorney, to be honest.</p>

<p>Here are some photos I took while doing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics at the Universidade do Porto.</p>

<p>On this day I was going to have a thermodynamics test, so I went to the physics room (available for all students to go in and study) and put it on the board everything I thought was important to know. I thought it looked really awesome so I took a picture.</p>

<p>And thus the habit was created ðŸ˜‚. This picture was taken somewhere in the Math department of the Falculty of Sciences and I was reviewing stuff for a Waves and Vibrationâ€™s test.</p>

<p>Doing some things with a LED in the physics laboratory.</p>

<p>Trust me, when we saw this stuff on the day this photo was taken we couldnâ€™t understand any of it either.</p>

<p>Some experiment that involved using capacitors and resistors.</p>

<p>Chalk boards are nice. Specially when they have some math stuff on them.</p>

<p>A multimeter with current coming from the frequency generator - we were probably trying to measure the gain in a OPAMP circuit.</p>
