I"r<p>One of the things I learned so far while studying a STEM field is the fact that, prior to taking the time to study a given subject, Iâ€™m usually wrong on the assertions I make. Due to its inherent difficulty and the high level of competence you need to have to get things right, being wrong is the default result, really. You have to study a bit to, for instance, understand the implications the second law of the thermodynamics or to know the physical meaning of the equation $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ (fun fact: it has to do with the fact that there are no - as far as anyone knows - magnetic monopoles in nature).</p>
