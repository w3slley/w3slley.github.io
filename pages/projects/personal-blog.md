As I explained a little bit in [this blogpost](/blog/personal-blog-using-nodejs-express-and-mysql), I've developed a personal blog website using Node.js and MySQL. On it, the author can add articles and tag each individual post with tag labels. This was mainly an attempt to get more familiarized with Node.js and how to write good and clean code on it - taking advantage of the MVC design pattern, among other practices.
