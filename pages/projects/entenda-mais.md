[Entenda Mais](https://facebook.com/entendama1s) is a science communication project (created by myself) aimed at using insightful images and graphics to promote physics, maths and science concepts in general. The project was created in 2017 and has more than 3 thousand followers on Facebook, its main medium for the publication of content.

The website was developed using the PHP framework Laravel. This experience marked the first contact I had with a back-end framework and also with the MVC pattern. An authentication system was implemented and authors can add, edit and delete articles published in the page. Readers can also leave comments on the posts/articles.
