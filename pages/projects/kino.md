**Website**: [kinowebapp.herokuapp.com](https://kinowebapp.herokuapp.com)

**Repo**: [github.com/w3slley/kino](https://github.com/w3slley/kino)


**Technologies used**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React

Implemented a full-stack movie web application where users can see more info on the movies they like. The website uses the [OMDB](https://omdbapi.com) movie API for the movie data as well as the YouTube API for the movie trailer. An authentication system using Local Storage was also implemented, and users can add movies to their favorite list.

The project was submitted to the [Dept back-end case assignment](https://www.deptagency.com/case-backend-developers/), which was part of the [2021 Digital Talent Virtual Fair](https://digitaltalent.easyvirtualfair.com/), and won first place in the contest.
