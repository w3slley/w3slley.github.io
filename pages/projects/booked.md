On Booked users can keep track of their reading habits by adding the books they already read on the platform. As with [Origami](/projects/origami), Booked was one of the first web applications I've developed. As one would expect, there are a number of improvements I still need to make to eliminate code that just isn't that good. One of them is to implement the MVC pattern or at least to try to separate the front-end from the logical part of the web app the most I can (you still can see some PHP code echoing HTML tags in some cases here). This was one of the first full-stack web application I've developed and it has since taught me invaluable lessons on web development in general. Looking back, this project also taught me how to avoid some practices (like the one I mentioned earlier) in order to write clean, scalable and maintainable code.
