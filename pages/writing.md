Writing is something that helps me think more clearly, enabling me to separate time to think about ideas and concepts and then trying to come up with words which better capture their meaning. It is one habit I try to dedicate time to whenever I can, which these days is usually when I find time between studying physics and creating new projects. On this section you can find some of the stuff I've written. 

### Fiction

A few short stories I wrote in the past couple of years. They were written in portuguese and I'll try to translate them eventually.

- [Ajudantes](/shortstories/ajudantes) *(english version soon...)*
- [O incÃªndio](/shortstories/o-incendio) *(english version soon...)*
