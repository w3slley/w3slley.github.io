A lot of interesting things happen while you study Physics. Sometimes you feel on top of the world knowing that all the mathematics you study explain beautifuly nature's behavior, feeling privileged by simply being able to understand concepts that took the human mind hundreds, if not thousands of years to discover; others you feel like crap wondering if this or that concept will ever make sense to you given its difficulty. It's a pretty interesting (but also challenging) jorney, to be honest.

Here are some photos I took while doing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at the Universidade do Porto.

On this day I was going to have a thermodynamics test, so I went to the physics room (available for all students to go in and study) and put it on the board everything I thought was important to know. I thought it looked really awesome so I took a picture.

And thus the habit was created &#128514;. This picture was taken somewhere in the Math department of the Falculty of Sciences and I was reviewing stuff for a Waves and Vibration's test.

Trust me, when we saw this stuff on the day this photo was taken we couldn't understand any of it either.

Some experiment that involved using capacitors and resistors.

Chalk boards are nice. Specially when they have some math stuff on them.

A multimeter with current coming from the frequency generator - we were probably trying to measure the gain in a OPAMP circuit.
